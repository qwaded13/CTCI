// 1.4 Palindrome Permutation
// Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome

// Does whitespace count as a character? - No for now

// in order to be a palindrome, need to have an even number of all chars
// only one char can be odd, needs to be the middle char

let palindromePermutation = function(s) {
  // build up a hash table of all the characters in the string
  // if the char doesn't exist as a key, create one
  // if it does, delete the key
  // if the length of the keys is greater than 1, return false
  // else return true
};
